> [!WARNING]  
> Rod n' Mod is still on it's alpha stage, so there may be bugs and issues. If you encounter any, please report them to me in the [issues page](https://github.com/nyxical420/rodnmod/issues) or at my discord! (@nyxical ID:583200866631155714)

## why?
i was bored... and it looks cool tbh

# Features
soon :P

# Requirements
- A webview runtime. I recommend having [Microsoft Edge Webview2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-edge/webview2#download) or similar. (Supported by pywebview)

# Troubleshooting / Known Stuff
- If Rod n' Mod doesn't close the splash screen, try exiting with ALT + F4 and relaunch Rod n' Mod.
    - This is a rare-ish occurence where pywebview api just can't be accessed on launch. It still tries to save you by refreshing the page though, although not a guarantee.
    - If you happen to have debugging enabled, please send me the webview error log!
- If it takes a while for you to install mods, try relaunching Rod n' Mod.
- Mods may not be detected by Rod n' Mod if installed from [HLS](https://hooklinesinker.lol/) because of how different Mod n' Rod handles installing/detecting mods.
